# Miles to Kilometers Converter

This is a simple GUI application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to convert distances from miles to kilometers.

**Features:**

* **User-friendly interface:** Provides an intuitive interface for input and output.
* **Input validation:** Handles invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values) gracefully.
* **Accurate conversion:** Performs accurate mile-to-kilometer conversions using the standard conversion factor.

**How to Use:**

1. **Run the script:** Execute the Python script.
2. **Enter miles:** Type the distance in miles into the input field.
3. **Click "Calculate":** The application will convert the miles to kilometers and display the result.
4. **Clear input:** Clear the input field to perform another conversion.

This project demonstrates basic GUI development with Tkinter, including:

* Creating and positioning GUI elements (labels, buttons, entry fields).
* Handling user input.
* Performing calculations.
* Displaying results.
* Basic error handling.
